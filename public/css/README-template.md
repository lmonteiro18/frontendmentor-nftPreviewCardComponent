### What I learned

This was my first Frontend Mentor Challenge even though I already have some experience in this area.
I tried to use classes with single styles so that I could reuse them and apply them to various elements without having to add individual styles for each one of them. I also tried to make the page responsive for a wide range of devices (besides the dimensions presented in the style-guide).
I could probably have created a component using a pure JavaScript function but since the aim of this challenge was practicing HTML and CSS and also the card wasn't going to be reused elsewhere I decided not to (I could also have used React JS but I haven't learned about that framework yet).
Edit: After some suggestions made by other users i learned some new things, like not to use 100vh in a global element like body because things will get disformed, or how to use aria hidden to hide decorative images from text-reader, or righting proper alt attributes. Also i learned how to use box-shadow.

### Continued development

I want to try to write CSS in a more organized way because most of the time I create a bunch of non-reusable classes and probably if another developer had to work over my code it would probably take him a lot of time to find the desired classes. That said i would like to learn more about CSS methodologies like BEM which i do not quite understand yet.
